## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Hotel Management System up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HariKrishnan-Ramesh/HOTEL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.git
    cd HOTEL_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    *   [**If Java (Spring Boot):**]
        ```bash
        mvn clean install  # If using Maven
        ```
    *   [**If Python (Django):**]
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt  # Create a requirements.txt file
        python manage.py migrate
        ```
    *   [**If Node.js (e.g. React/Angular for front end):**]
        ```bash
        cd frontend  # Or the directory containing your frontend code
        npm install
        ```

3.  **Configure the Database:**

    *   Create a database in your chosen database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    *   Update the database connection settings in the application's configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` for Spring Boot, `settings.py` for Django).  Specify the database host, port, name, username, and password.

4.  **[Add platform specific installation steps if necessary]**

5.  **[Build the Application (if necessary)]**

    *   [If applicable for frontend]
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm run build
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    *   [**If Java (Spring Boot):**]
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    *   [**If Python (Django):**]
        ```bash
        python manage.py runserver
        ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Application (if separate):**

    *   [**If Node.js:**]
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm start
        ```

3.  **Access the Application:**

    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the address where the application is running (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` for Spring Boot, `http://localhost:3000` for a React frontend).

4.  **[Provide instructions on how to use the application. Be specific!]**

    *   Example: "Login with the default admin credentials (username: admin, password: password - *change this immediately!*)."
    *   Example: "Navigate to the 'Rooms' section to add or edit room information."
    *   Example: "Use the 'Bookings' section to create new reservations and manage existing ones."

**Important Notes and Customization:**

*   **Replace Placeholders:**  Carefully replace all the bracketed placeholders with the correct information specific to *your* project. This is crucial for a useful and accurate README.
*   **Database Setup:**  The database setup is critical. Provide very detailed instructions, including how to create the database, configure the connection, and run migrations (if applicable).
*   **Dependencies:** Accurately list all dependencies in the "Technologies Used" section and provide clear instructions on how to install them in the "Setup and Installation" section.  A `requirements.txt` file (for Python) or equivalent is highly recommended.
*   **Specific Instructions:** The "Usage" section is where you really guide the user.  Don't assume they know anything about your application.  Provide step-by-step instructions with clear examples, including screenshots/gifs if possible.
*   **Security:**  If there are default credentials, *strongly* advise users to change them immediately.  Mention any other security considerations.
*   **License:** Include a LICENSE file in your repository. The MIT License is a common choice, but choose the one that best suits your needs. Ensure the badge links correctly.
*   **Badges:** Use badges to show the project status, license, last commit, etc. Update the links to point to your repository. You can find more badges on sites like Shields.io.
*   **Error Handling:**  If there are known common errors, you may want to include a section on troubleshooting them.

This improved README provides a solid foundation for your project. Remember to tailor it to your specific application and keep it updated as your project evolves. Good luck!
